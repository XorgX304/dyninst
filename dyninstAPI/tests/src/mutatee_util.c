 All this to stop ourselves.  We may be detached, but the mutator
 needs to notice the stop.  We must send a SIGILL to ourselves, not
 SIGSTOP, to get the mutator to notice.

 DYNINSTsigill is a runtime library function that does this.  Here we
 obtain a pointer to DYNINSTsigill from the runtime loader and then
 call it.  Note that this depends upon the mutatee having
 DYNINSTAPI_RT_LIB defined (with the same value as mutator) in its
 environment, so this technique does not work for ordinary mutatees.

 We could call kill to send ourselves SIGILL, but this is unsupported
 because it complicates the SIGILL signal handler.  */
